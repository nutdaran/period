## Pain point

Many women, including me, often forgot their ovulation day of period.
When time comes, we always need to ask for sanitary napkin from everyone. Therefore, 
I decided to create an application that help reminding the user the ovulation date and
make a note of period blood to use for further purpose like seeing an obstetrician.

## Features
- showing the next ovulation day
- calculate the next ovulation day
- memo the color, texture, and flow of the period

## UI design
